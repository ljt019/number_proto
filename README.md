# Number Prototype

A prototype of a potential number exhibit, that teaches about training an ai, and how the dataset can effect the models' output.

## Goals

- Teach users about training an ai
- Teach users about epochs, loss, and overfitting

## Exhibit Flow

- Draw Numbers 1-9 and math symbols for add, subtract, multiply, divide, and equal
- Train an ai on that data, while training show information to user teaching about training process
- Provide canvas equations can be written on, have ai automatically answer equations

## Needed

- [ ] Way to collect training data
- [ ] Pretrained ai that can be fed collected training data
- [ ] Set it up to do math on numbers/equations written
